**SilverTunnel-Monteux Netlib**
====================

**SilverTunnel-Monteux Netlib** is a free library for the Java programming language that implements and encapsulates all the complex network protocol logic needed for anonymous communication over the Tor anonymity network. Netlib can be easily integrated in almost every existing and new Java application. The library requires Java 1.6/Java SE 6 or a newer version.

This is a fork of the _SilverTunnel-NG Netlib_, which in its turn is a fork of the original _SilverTunnel Netlib_.

The original _silvertunnel Netlib_ can be found here : [silvertunnel.org](http://silvertunnel.org/)

The original _silvertunnel-ng Netlib_ can be found here: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/silvertunnel-ng/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/silvertunnel-ng/)

This fork contains fixes and improvements over the original library, and is being used as a dependency in the development of the secure peer to peer instant messenger '_Tor Messenger_'.
